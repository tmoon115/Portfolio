How to make a real P B and J sandwitch.
1. Select the type of bread you want to use. Many prefer the taste of %a1 bread, while others prefer %n2 bread because it is healthy. 
2. Choose your favorite Jam or Jelly. I personally prefer super %a3 jam, but you can use whatever you want, such as %f4 jelly. 
3. Choose the type of peanut butter, either creamy or %a5. 
4. Take out 2 slices of bread. 
5. Use a %n6 to %v7 the jam all over the pieces of bread. 
6. Now %v8 the peanut butter on the other piece of bread. 
7. Put them together, and you have a real P B and J %n9.
