Information about me and the collection of projects I have worked on throughout college

#Hello, my name is Tyler Moon
I am a senior computer science major at the University of North Georgia, with a current standing of a 4.0 GPA. I am looking to go into video game programming in the future, as it has been a dream of mine for a very long time. I have worked on coding in various different languages throughout these years; this includes C++, Java, C, Python, Ada, PHP, HTML, JavaScript, and node.JS. I have used these languages to create many different types of projects, such as traffic light control software, Alexa skills, mobile applications, and even lexical analyzers/parsers.
